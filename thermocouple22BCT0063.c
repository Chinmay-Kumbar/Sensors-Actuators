  Simulates a temperature reading from a thermocouple sensor.
  Thermocouples measure temperature based on the voltage generated 
  due to the Seebeck effect. This function simulates the sensor's behavior 
  by generating a random voltage and considering cold junction compensation.
  yearsElapsed Number of years elapsed (used for simulating sensor drift).
  The computed temperature in degrees Celsius.
