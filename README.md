// This program simulates temperature readings from four types of sensors:
// Thermocouple, RTD (Thermoresistive), Thermooptical, and Thermoacoustic sensors.
// It logs the data into a CSV file, filters out outliers, and determines whether
// a fan or heater should be activated based on the average temperature.
